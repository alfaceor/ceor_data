\TODO{Change Abstract}
Ariane's paper summary:

Urinary tract infection (UTI), mainly caused by Escherichia coli, are frequent and have a recurrent nature even
after antibiotic treatment. Potential bacterial escape mechanisms include growth defects, but probing bacterial division in vivo and establishing its relation to the antibiotic response remain challenging. Using a synthetic reporter of cell division, we follow the temporal dynamics of cell division for different E. coli clinical
strains in a UTI mouse model with and without antibiotics. We show that more bacteria are actively dividing in the kidneys and urine compared with the bladder. Bacteria that survive antibiotic treatment are consistently non-dividing in three sites of infection. 
Additionally, we demonstrate how both the strain in vitro persistence profile and the microenvironment impact infection and treatment dynamics. Understanding the relative
contribution of the host environment, growth heterogeneity, non-dividing bacteria, and antibiotic persistence is crucial to improve therapies for recurrent infections.

A total of \TODO{(Add the correct number when finish if all strains with all ATB or not)} 8-week-old healthy female CBA/J mice were intravesically infected, at day 0, with $10^8$ colony forming units (CFU) of PAS strain\cite{kotula2014programmable} and divided in three groups\cite{amoura2024variability}(76 mice without antibiotic, 17 with 2.5mg/kg and 7 with 10 mg/kg of ciprofloxacin during 2 days of treatment two times a day).




The CFU counts in each organ were determined by scaling the density of CFU/g measured in kidney and bladder by the organ weight after sacrifice. For urine, a scaling factor of 1ml was assumed. Mice without antibiotic treatment were sacrificed on days 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 16 and 22. Mice with antibiotic treatment were only sacrificed on day 4.

\subsubsection{Ethics Statement} 
\TODO{The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of ... and received approval from the ... }

\subsection{Statistical model}

Nonlinear mixed effects modeling approach was used to analyze the different markers over time. A nonlinear mixed effects model for multiple responses is defined as follows. Let $y_i$ denote the vector of observations for all responses and  the vector $y_{i,k}$ of observations for the $k$th response (e.g. k=1 corresponds to CFU in kidney, k=2 to CFU in bladder, etc) for the individual $i$. Let $f$ denote the global structural model characterizing all responses, based on a system of ordinary differential equations, similar for all individuals.
Then one can define $ y_{i,k} = f_{k}(\theta_i, \xi_{i,k} ) + \epsilon_{i,k} $ where $f_{k}$ is the component of the global model $f$ describing the $k$th response, $\theta_i$ is the vector of individual parameters, $\xi_{i,k}$ is the vector of the $n_{i,k}$ sampling times and $\epsilon_{i,k}$ is the vector of residual errors for the  response in individual $i$. Each individual parameter $\theta_i$ can be decomposed as a fixed effect $\mu$, which represents the mean value of the parameter in the population, and a random effect $b_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Omega)$ where $\Omega$ accounts for the inter-individual variability. Assuming an exponential random effect model, the individual parameters are modeled as : $\theta_i = \mu \exp(b)$.
Lastly we assumed that $\epsilon_{i,k} \sim \mathcal{N} (0, \Sigma_{i,k})$ where $\Sigma_{i,k}$ is a $ n_{i,k} \times n_{i,k}$-diagonal matrix with $k$th elements equal to $(\theta_{inter,k} + \sigma_{slope,k}\times f_{k}(\theta_i, \xi_{i,k}))^2$ with $\sigma_{inter, k}$ being the paremeter for the additive part and $\sigma_{slope,k}$ the parameter for the proportional part of the variance error model. Constant ($\sigma_{inter, k} \neq 0$, $\sigma_{slope, k} = 0$), proportional ($\sigma_{inter, k} = 0$, $\sigma_{inter, k} \neq 0$, ) or combined ($\sigma_{inter, k} \neq 0$, $\sigma_{slope, k} \neq 0$ ) variance error models were tested for each response $k$.

\TODO{Define order strain or antibiotic effect first? I think is better strain, because antibiotic has less data perhaps?}

\subsubsection{Model without antibiotic treatment in PAS strain}

To investigate the dynamics of bacterial proliferation and migration in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, we examined both a logistic growth model Eq. (\ref{eq:ODElogistic}) and an effective elimination/proliferation rate model Eq. (\ref{eq:ODEeffect}) within a three-compartment framework, representing the kidney($K$), bladder($B$), and urine ($U$). 
%
The model accounted for exchange rates between compartments to capture bacterial migration between compartments.
%
We tested all combinations of logistic growth and effective elimination/proliferation rates across all compartments to comprehensively evaluate their effects on bacterial dynamics.
%
Our initial focus was on the PAS bacterial strain in mice that were not subjected to antibiotic treatment, allowing us to study the natural progression of infection and bacterial spread without external intervention.

\TODO{Should I include the logistic growth equations? I imaging that for completeness I could write it but maybe in the appendix. Or maybe a general equation for one compartment but probably will not be easy to read.}

$\delta_K$, $\delta_B$, and $\delta_U$ are effective proliferation rates.  $q_{X,Y}$ the migration rate from compartment $X$ to $Y$ with $X, Y \in \{K,B,U\}$

\subsubsection{Model with antibiotic treatment in PAS strain}

We investigated the effect of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin on mice infected with the PAS strain, focusing on groups that received no treatment as well as those treated with two doses: 2.5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg. Given the absence of measured drug concentrations, we assumed that the antibiotic primarily influences the effective growth rates of the bacteria. To explore this assumption, we tested three different models: a model with no effect of the antibiotic, a linear model with dose dependence, and a non-linear model to evaluate the impact of the antibiotic on bacterial dynamics.

\begin{alignat}{1}
\delta_{X}^{Cipro} &= \left( 1 \pm \mathcal{A}(D^{Cipro} ) \right) \delta_{X}
\end{alignat}
where $\mathcal{A}(D^{Cipro} )$ is the functional dependency of corresponding administrated dosage, $delta_X$ the effective proliferation rate in the compartment $X \in \{K, B, U\}$.


\begin{alignat}{2}
	\mathcal{A}(D^{Cipro}) &= 0, & \text{No effect} \\
	\mathcal{A}(D^{Cipro}) &= \epsilon_{X} D^{Cipro}, & \text{Linear} \\
	\mathcal{A}(D^{Cipro}) &= \beta_{D^{Cipro}, D_1}\Phi_{D_1} + \beta_{D^{Cipro}, D_2}\Phi_{D_2}, & \text{No linear}
\end{alignat}

\begin{alignat}{1}
\delta_{K}^{Cipro} &= 1 - \epsilon_K D^{Cipro} \delta_{K} \nonumber \\
\delta_{U}^{Cipro} &= 1 + \epsilon_U D^{Cipro} \delta_{U}
\end{alignat}




\subsubsection{Strain covariates}
A forward covariate selection procedure was applied to assess the influence of different bacterial strains on both the elimination/proliferation rates and the exchange rates between compartments. Starting with the PAS strain as the base model, additional bacterial strains were tested individually as covariates. The Bayesian Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes (BICc) was used to assess model improvement, with strains retained if they led to a reduction in BICc.
%
This process was repeated iteratively, with one covariate added at a time. The final model included only those covariates that significantly reduced BICc.


%\begin{alignat}
%	\frac{d}{dt} X = \alpha_{X} \left( 1 - \frac{X}{X^{ss}} \right)X + \sum_{Y \neq X} q_{X,Y} X + q_{Y,X} Y
%\end{alignat}






%\subsection{Parameter estimation}

\subsection{Model estimation and evaluation}

Estimation of population parameters was performed using the stochastic approximation expectation maximisation algorithm (SAEM) \cite{kuhn2005maximum}, implemented in Monolix 2021R2 (Lixoft, Orsay, France, www.lixoft.eu), a software devoted to parameter estimation by maximum likelihood in nonlinear mixed effect models. Data below the lower limit of quantification were treated as left-censored data. Their contribution to the likelihood was computed as the probability that these data are indeed below the lower limit of quantification\cite{samson2006extension}. 


Model evaluation was carried out using the goodness-of-fit was assessed by inspecting diagnostic plots (e.g., observed vs. predicted values, residuals vs. fitted values)

In addition, model selection was guided by comparing BIC where appropriate. The final model was selected based on the best fit to the data. \TODO{detail model strategy in accordance with new figure 2 to 3.}

\section{Conclusions}

\TODO{Fix it}
The competition of bacteria elimination and proliferation are different in the three compartments.
The relationship among bladder, kidney and urine exchange rates indicates that the urine compartment is the main path to elimination and the large proliferation in the kidney positions it as the primary source of a long lasting bacteria. The persistence of bacteria in the bladder despite the administration of ciprofloxacin, even at higher concentrations has been reported before.\cite{jakobsen2020ciprofloxacin} In this study we presented a reduced comprehensive mathematical model of the colonisation in UTI organs for PAS E. coli under the administration of two doses of ciprofloxacin which is the starting point to develop better models with other antibiotics with different mechanism of action and different strains.
